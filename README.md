## Summary
The dataset contains information about United State flight performance in 2017, I used unique carrier as flight identity. This project shows what kind of flight with most canceled and or diverted in 2017, and what flight with the most freequent delay. There are 4 reasons for cancelation (A = carrier, B = weather, C = NAS, D = security), and 5 reasons of delay (carrier delay, weather delay, National Aviation System(NAS) delay, security delay, late-arriving aircraft delay). Because there is NAS factor of delay, this project also shows what airports with the most frequent delay.
